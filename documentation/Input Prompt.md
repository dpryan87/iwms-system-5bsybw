Below is a high-level product definition for a lightweight Integrated Workplace Management System (IWMS) designed to handle key aspects of spatial and asset management without the complexity and overhead of a full-scale IWMS suite.

Product Definition: Lightweight IWMS

Target Users:
	•	Corporate Real Estate Teams
	•	Facility Managers
	•	Space Planners
	•	Business Unit (BU) Administrators

Core Value Proposition:
Provide a simplified, intuitive platform to visualize and manage physical spaces, assign resources and business units to specific areas, track and renew leases efficiently, and integrate occupancy data for data-driven decision-making—all without the complexity and cost typically associated with larger IWMS solutions.

Key Features

1. Map & Floorplan Management
	•	Interactive Floor Maps:
Upload and maintain up-to-date floorplans (2D/3D) of buildings and workspaces. Users can easily navigate through buildings, floors, and rooms.
	•	Resource/Business Unit Assignment:
Assign workstations, meeting rooms, storage areas, and other resources to specific business units. Color-coded overlays and filters help visualize which BU owns which space.
	•	Intuitive Space Editing Tools:
Simple drag-and-drop tools to update room assignments, label resource types, and mark areas as available, reserved, or under maintenance.
	•	Version Control & History Tracking:
Keep a history of changes to maps (e.g., office reconfigurations or BU moves) for audit and planning purposes.

2. Lease Management
	•	Centralized Lease Repository:
Store and organize lease documents, terms, and renewal dates in a single interface. Support for multiple property types (office, warehouse, retail).
	•	Key Date Alerts & Reminders:
Automated notifications for approaching lease expirations, rent escalations, and critical lease milestones.
	•	Financial Tracking & Reporting:
Basic tools to track rent payments, CAM charges, and allocate costs to relevant BUs.
	•	Scalable to Multiple Locations:
Handle leases across multiple buildings or regions with easy filtering and reporting capabilities.

3. Occupancy Data Integration
	•	Data Ingestion from Sensors & Systems:
Integrate with occupancy sensors, IoT devices, or building management systems to capture real-time or periodic occupancy counts.
	•	Space Utilization Insights:
Analyze occupancy patterns over time. Identify underutilized workstations, meeting rooms, or entire floors, enabling data-driven decisions about space allocation or downsizing.
	•	Dynamic Floorplan Overlays:
Visually overlay occupancy data on floor maps to see where people are working and how space is being used throughout the day.

4. Additional Relevant Features
	•	User Roles & Access Control:
Assign different permission levels (e.g., Admin, BU Manager, Viewer) to ensure secure and appropriate access to maps, lease data, and occupancy insights.
	•	Reporting & Analytics Dashboards:
Pre-built dashboards for viewing key metrics: vacancy rates, cost per square foot, utilization percentages, and approaching lease deadlines.
	•	Mobile-Friendly Interface:
Responsive design so managers can view maps, lease details, and occupancy data from tablets or smartphones when on-site.
	•	Data Export & Integrations:
Simple APIs and export tools to integrate data with HR systems (for employee counts), Finance systems (for cost allocations), or project management tools.
	•	Basic Maintenance & Service Requests (Optional):
Although lightweight, include a simple system for logging maintenance requests tied to specific spaces or resources, providing basic support functionality.

Differentiators
	•	Simplicity and Ease of Use:
Focus on core functionality with an intuitive UI that can be adopted quickly by non-technical staff.
	•	Lightweight and Cost-Effective:
Fewer complex modules than full IWMS suites, making it more affordable and faster to deploy.
	•	Flexibility & Scalability:
Start small with a single building and expand as needed without overwhelming complexity.

In essence, this lightweight IWMS focuses on strong visualization (maps), streamlined lease management, and actionable occupancy insights—all wrapped in a user-friendly package that avoids the heavyweight, enterprise complexity of traditional IWMS platforms.

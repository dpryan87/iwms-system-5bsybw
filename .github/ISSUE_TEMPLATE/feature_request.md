## Business Case

### Problem Statement
<!-- Describe the current problem or need (minimum 50 characters)
Example: Currently, facility managers lack real-time visibility into space utilization across multiple floors, leading to inefficient space allocation and resource management. -->

### Proposed Solution
<!-- Describe your proposed solution and its business value
Example: Implement a real-time dashboard showing space utilization metrics with drill-down capabilities by building, floor, and department. -->

### User Impact
<!-- Describe how this feature will impact user workflows and system processes
Example: Facility managers will be able to make data-driven decisions about space allocation, leading to improved space utilization and cost savings. -->

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
<!-- List detailed functional requirements (minimum 100 characters)
Example:
1. Real-time occupancy data visualization
2. Filtering capabilities by building/floor/department
3. Export functionality for reports
4. Alert configuration for utilization thresholds -->

### Technical Considerations
<!-- Describe technical implementation details and architecture considerations
Example:
- Integration with existing occupancy sensors
- Data storage requirements
- Performance impact on the system
- Security implications -->

### Integration Points
<!-- Check all required integration points: -->
